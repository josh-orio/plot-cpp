# C++ & Matplotlib

This library uses C++ and Python 'shaders' to produce graphical plots for C++ executables such as financial models (my undergrad project coming soon).

Such an approach can seem a little bit jank. The C++ executable uses a Python session and passes data through to it to be 'rendered'. That said, if you don't want a codebase with Python scripts, you can write your shader code directly into the .cpp file as a string.

This repo contains an example of an executable and a seperate .py shader file.

This image is generated by the library, it's just a simple example but you could make more complex plots such as volatility curves ;)

## Requirements

- Linux or MacOS
- CMake
- g++ (or some equivalent)
- Python3
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Run the following lines in a terminal to install the library:

```

cd plot-cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
sudo make -j install
```
